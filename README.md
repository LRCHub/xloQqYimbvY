```lrc
[00:13.63] Hunger for the sleep I know will never come
[00:20.41] Crowded is the space but don't have anyone
[00:27.17] I could read the Bible to drown out the hum
[00:33.49] Avoid the voices of the Chord
[00:47.99] 
[00:40.79] All the roads inside my head loop back to you
[00:47.39] I've done many things I'd thought I'd never do
[00:53.72] It's you that I can feel
[00:59.13] But I keep my hands
[01:02.38] Upon the wheel
[01:09.38] 
[01:06.15] I turn the page to drown you out
[01:12.55] You are the only thing that I still care about
[01:19.30] If I can heal the conflict that's within
[01:26.29] I'll know the war has reached the bitter end
[01:48.29] 
[01:35.72] Ocean, you're calling me
[01:42.08] A place with no memory
[01:47.45] You'll see!
[01:48.52] I burned the Blood
[01:50.31] I passed the test
[01:51.92] And now my love is laid to rest
[01:55.49] Our names aren't written on the list
[02:13.49] 
[02:00.07] I turn the page to drown you out
[02:06.65] You are the only thing that I still care about
[02:13.45] If I can heal the conflict that's within
[02:20.31] I'll know the war has reached the bitter end
[02:42.31] 
[02:29.55] Ocean, you're calling me
[02:36.31] A place with no memory
[02:41.58] You'll see!
[02:42.86] I burned the blood
[02:44.38] I passed the test
[02:45.94] And now my love is laid to rest
[02:49.38] Our names aren't written on the list
[02:52.72] But you and I know we exist
